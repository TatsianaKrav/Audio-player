                    <p class="about-text">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics show
                        that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will continue to live with us and will be
                        waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get
                        sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers
                        and 28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter
                        staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave
                        them alone.</p>
